I am an enthusiastic and dedicated individual who has recently completed a bachelor's degree in Microbiology, with a particular interest in cell and molecular biology, cancer biology, and immunology.

Through my studies, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms that govern the human body at a cellular level, and I am passionate about making a positive impact in the field of microbiology. In addition to my scientific expertise, I also have programming skills in SQL and basic Python, which allows me to approach scientific problems with a versatile and analytical mindset.

I am keenly interested in staying up-to-date with the latest findings in my areas of interest, including recent research on cancer immunotherapies and the potential of RNA interference in molecular biology. With a strong drive to contribute to the field of microbiology, I am excited to explore new opportunities and apply my knowledge to make a meaningful impact.
